# Third-Person-Stealth
A basic "stealth" game demonstration project, using the Unity Engine, where the objective is to reach the finish area (area with a checkered banner surrounding it), and not get caught by the robot (represented by a capsule with a red eye).
## Features
- AI that chases the player, using a state machine for logic representation.
- Two levels that are added additively to a main level that holds level-independent logic.
- Buttons that can interacted with by the player when they are in-range.
- Locked doors that are opened by pressing all linked buttons.
- A camera that avoids collision with level geometry, although will shear the player.
